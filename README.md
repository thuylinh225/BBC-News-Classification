# BBC-News-Classification
We have BBC News Train and BBC News Test data downloaded from Kaggle which consists of 5 categories in total:

And the goal is to assign one category to a news article in test data. The five categories we want to identify are Sports, Business, Politics, Tech, and Entertainment.

To do this, we will train two models: 

(1) an unsupervised model using matrix factorization.  
(2) multiple supervised model such as SVM, KNN, Random Forest.     

These models are built to have their testing accuracy and then I will compare these models for their performance.
